# Intro

This repository contains all the code needed to reproduce all the simulations and real data experiments presented in the paper *Scalable inference via averaged Robbins-Monro bootstrap*.

## How to use this repository

Clone the repository locally with

`git clone https://github.com/giuseppealfonzetti/armb_experiments`

Use [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to restore the `R` environment:

``` r
renv::restore()
```

Run `make` in the terminal to run the experiments pipeline, or use the `Build All` button from Rstudio.

As can be inspected in the `Makefile`, running the pipeline creates an `output/` folder where all results will be stored, and a `data/` folder where the data for the real data application will be downloaded.

## Description

The `R/` folder contains the scripts:

-   `mle.R`: script used to evaluate the MLE across all simulations;
-   `ground_truth.R` : script used to evaluate the ORACLE method across all simulations;
-   `bootstrap.R`: script used to evaluate nonparametric BOOTSTRAP across all simulations;
-   `blb.R`: script used to evaluate BLB across all simulations;
-   `armb.R`: script used to evaluate ARM-B across all simulations;

The simulation settings are automatically generated by the scripts contained in the `R/sett/` folder.

The `R/` folder also contains the scripts: 

- `sims_plots.R`, which reproduces the plots presented in the main paper and supplementary material regarding the simulated experiments; 
- `realdata_aps.R`, which reproduces the results of the real data application on the APS dataset; 
- `realdata_appendix.R`, which reproduces the results for the additional datasets reported in the supplementary material.

Finally, note that you can specify the number of cores to be used by changing the value of `num_cores` in `Makefile`.
